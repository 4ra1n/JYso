üëä**JYso** is a tool that can be used as both ysoserial and JNDIExploit. It also has bypass functions of multiple JNDI high versions, WAF, and RASP.

# üöÄ Getting Started Guide

üì¢ Please be sure to take a moment to read this document, which will help you quickly become familiar with JYso!

üßê Use documentation [Wiki](https://github.com/qi4L/JYso/wiki).

‚úî Download the latest version of [Releases](https://github.com/qi4L/JYso/releases).

# üê≤Features

+ JNDI account activation
+ JNDI routing hidden or encrypted
+ JNDI high version Bypass
+ 12 available echo classes
+ 18 available memshell classes, and supports modifying the memshell path, password, authentication HTTP header and value
+ 76 available Gadgets and provide multiple ways to use them
+ Memory horse supports [No file landing Agent entry](https://xz.aliyun.com/t/10075?time__1311=mq%2BxBD9QDQe4yDBkPoN%2BuDAO%3DnB5x&alichlgref=https%3A%2F%2Fxz.aliyun.com%2Fsearch%3Fkeyword%3Drebeyond)
+ write the memshell to JRE or environment variable to hide
+ Serialized data plus dirty data
+ [Serialized data is encoded in UTF-8 corresponding to 3 bytes](https://whoopsunix.com/docs/PPPYSO/advance/UTFMIX/)
+ Secondary deserialization of SignedObject, which can be used to bypass TemplatesImpl blacklist, CC countless groups and blacklists that often appear in CTF, etc.
+ To solve the problem that the Shiro Header header is too long, obtain the value of the specified parameter from the request for class loading.
+ Dynamically generate obfuscated class names
+ MSF/CS online
+ Code execution via JDBC
